NBody Simulation using OpenCL/OpenGL (brute force)
===================

This repository was created for a blog post at http://masblogcentral.wordpress.com/. Contact me for any questions.
Unfortunately, this only works on the Mac OS. However, if you want to run it on Windows, it's all about getting the right include/lib files.

Todo:
- Use OpenCL/OpenGL interop, rather than using the host memory.
- Add support for Windows.
